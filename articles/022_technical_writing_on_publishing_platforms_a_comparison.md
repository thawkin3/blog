I love to write.

Writing was one of my goals for 2020, and it’s now been about six months of doing so. During that time, I’ve been able to publish 21 articles discussing software engineering topics on platforms such as Medium, DEV, Hacker Noon, and freeCodeCamp. It’s even turned into a freelancing gig for me!

One thing that has fascinated me over the last six months is trying to understand the kind of audiences that these various platforms attract. I often cross-post my articles on at least a couple of these sites each time I publish, and the community response sometimes varies drastically from platform to platform.

I’ve been keeping an eye on the number of views, reads, likes or claps, and engagement through reader comments on each article, and I think I’m finally beginning to see some patterns emerge.

These conclusions are based solely on my experience, so I’m certain there’s more nuance to it than I’ll describe below, but here’s what I’ve found:

---

## Medium

First up, Medium. [Medium](https://medium.com/) is a publishing platform for more than just software engineers, but I’ll constrain my thoughts to just this one category.

One of the draws of Medium is that *anyone* can publish articles here. However, that also means there’s *a lot* of content being created. Getting your article added to a publication or curated by the Medium editors often boosts your readership much higher than anything self-published.

It seems that Medium readers tend to engage most with articles that are short and offer an opinionated perspective. Lengthier technical articles or step-by-step how-to articles haven’t been well-received here, at least not for me.

For example, my article that explains why Storybook is awesome has nearly 10,000 views!

## DEV

Next we have DEV. [DEV](https://dev.to/) is a platform specifically for developers, so everything is about programming and software engineering. DEV appears to be heavily targeted at junior developers and those first learning to code. Because of that, the articles that tend to do best here are simple tutorials and short articles on beginner topics.

Just like Medium, DEV allows anyone to write and post content. Unlike Medium however, DEV doesn’t offer individual publications or curation by editors to promote content. The best content makes its way to the top based on merit alone.

DEV also feels more like a community or a forum than Medium does. Quite often readers will comment with some additional perspectives, some code examples, or even just a short “thank you”.

I recently wrote an article on React component state that was trending as the number two article for React on DEV one week! I’m not sure if it was the clickbaity title or the fact that it included “junior developers” in the title, but this piece has by far been my most popular one on DEV.

## Hacker Noon

[Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/) is another platform focused solely on software engineering. Readers of Hacker Noon tend to like the meatier, more in-depth articles. I haven’t received very many comments on my articles, but that seems to be the norm. As opposed to DEV, Hacker Noon feels like a place to read and learn but not so much of a forum.

One article that has had readers reading for over a collective 24 hours now was my in-depth look into the new features released in ES2020, complete with a demo app.

## freeCodeCamp

Finally, let’s look at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This one is near and dear to my heart. When I was first learning to code, freeCodeCamp was my go-to resource. I loved the project challenges it provided that gave you user requirements and then set you loose to build an app that satisfied all the requirements. It was very similar to how the development process works in the real world.

freeCodeCamp has their own blog called [freeCodeCamp News](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/), and it turns out they’re very selective in who they allow to publish on their platform. I submitted an application, and a few weeks later, I was accepted! It feels good to be able to give back to a community that helped me learn when I was first starting out.

Due to freeCodeCamp’s mission of helping people learn how to code, many of their readers are aspiring developers. However, they love the long in-depth tutorials and how-to articles. These developers are trying to learn everything they can in order to make it in the software engineering world, so the more technical the article, the better (as long as you explain simply!).

I noticed a lack of good tutorials for creating webpack 4 configurations, so I spent a good bit of time writing a tutorial on this subject. freeCodeCamp encourages its readers to actively share content on Twitter, and it was amazing seeing my article tweeted and retweeted.

## Conclusion

Finding the right audience can be tricky. It’s still something I’m trying to nail down as I seek to find my niche. Hopefully these observations will help you along on your writing journey as you seek to find yours too!
