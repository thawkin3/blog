# How to Use the VoiceOver Screen Reader

If you are a frontend software engineer building web applications, accessibility is an essential component to keep in mind. While there are many automated tools out there that can help you in your accessibility efforts, none of these are adequate replacements for simple manual testing with a keyboard and with a screen reader.

Therefore, frontend engineers need to learn how to use a screen reader.

Screen readers are assistive technology that help blind or low-vision users to navigate their computers. VoiceOver is a screen reader that ships with the operating system on every Mac.

If you’re not familiar with screen readers, learning how to use one can feel like a daunting task. But, it’s actually not that hard to get started! By learning just a few simple commands, you can be navigating your web app in no time.

In this article we’ll go over some of the most common VoiceOver commands to help you get started.

## Conclusion

That’s it! During 90% of my navigation with a screen reader, I find myself using just a few of the commands listed above. I’ll turn on VoiceOver with `Command + F5`, navigate through the page using `Control + Option + Right/Left Arrows`, and interact with clickable content using `Control + Option + Space`.
