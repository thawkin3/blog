This year I decided I wanted to start writing. So I did.

I’ve been doing software engineering for about six years and I’ve learned a thing or two in that time. I’m still in the early stages of my career though, and there’s lots more ahead and lots more to learn.

But so far, I’ve learned that I love to learn. I love to read. I love to teach. And I love to mentor.

Medium has given me a platform where I can expand my influence and help share my knowledge with the rest of the world.

In this article, I’ll explore some of the highlights and some of the lowlights I’ve experienced over the last month of writing.

## Highlights

### Community response

The most incredible thing to me so far has been the response I’ve gotten from the community.

By no means am I a wildly successful writer here, but to have my articles read by thousands of people is amazing to me. I never imagined that anyone would be *that *interested in what I have to say. It’s opened my eyes.

I’m not very active in the Twitter-sphere, but to see [my article on designing accessible forms](https://uxdesign.cc/10-tips-for-designing-accessible-forms-a016dae8e9aa?source=friends_link&sk=e379de219c1d1ddadf8af8284c22e298) picked up and tweeted by UX news sites, publications, and other designers was a huge confidence booster.

My articles have been liked, shared, tweeted, highlighted, and commented on by real, live people!

### Solidified learning

The best way to retain what you’ve learned is to teach.

By taking the time to write down my thoughts, I’ve been able to get a better picture of what I understand and what I don’t. Maybe I thought I understood a concept really well but then struggled to explain a few core pieces. Identifying that knowledge gap and then closing it by studying those points further has been a great way to sharpen my skills.

### Side hustle

One of the nice things about writing on Medium is the Partner Program. You can get paid for your articles based on how much time Medium members spend reading your articles.

Only a handful of people make a crazy amount of money on Medium and I’m not one of them.

But, writing has more than paid for my Medium membership, and it’s given me a little extra fun money. It’s even opened up exciting new opportunities for me to do some paid ghostwriting!

If nothing else, Medium is a great place to begin writing and get your name out there.

## Lowlights

OK, let’s look at the lowlights.

### Lack of engagement (sometimes)

I’ve published eight stories on Medium so far. Some have been pretty successful, at least by my standards. But others have received only a few hundred views. This can be discouraging, especially when it’s an article that I put several hours into writing and thought was well-crafted.

But, such is life. If nothing else, those articles were for my own edification and the enjoyment of a few select people.

### Other lowlights?

That’s it, really. If writing is something you enjoy (which it is for me), then the only real disappointment would be if your article was not well-received. I’ve no expectations of earning a substantial income through Medium. If you do, don’t get your hopes up too high!

## What’s Next?

Now that my first month is over, what’s next? More writing!

I’ll continue to write on Medium and share some more insights on software engineering, web development, and JavaScript.

I’ve also explored writing on other platforms like dev.to (check out my article on [the role of tests in refactoring](https://dev.to/thawkin3/tests-are-for-the-future-3a4d)) and Hacker Noon (check out my articles on [test-driven development](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-test-driven-development-7pat3yeh) and [web accessibility guidelines](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-your-website-accessible-wcag-21-w3c-recommendation-zda53yad)). If all goes well, I may even have some articles published on [freeCodeCamp’s news site](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) soon!

Writing is a process, and so is finding a well-suited publishing platform and target audience.

## Conclusion

Writing technical articles on Medium has been a wonderful experience so far. It’s expanded my reach, solidified my learning, and opened up several new opportunities for me in my career.

If you’re thinking about writing, I’d encourage you to do so!

And if you’re a seasoned writing professional and have some insights on how to get the most out of Medium or other publishing platforms, I’d love to hear your comments too.

Thanks for reading!
